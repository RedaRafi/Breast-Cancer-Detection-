# Breast Cancer Detection Using CNN in Python
Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. There were over 2 million new cases in 2018, making it a significant health problem in present days.  The key challenge in breast cancer detection is to classify tumors as malignant or benign. Malignant refers to cancer cells that can invade and kill nearby tissue and spread to other parts of your body. Unlike cancerous tumor(malignant), Benign does not spread to other parts of the body and is safe somehow. Deep neural network techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis significantly.  Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called an artificial neural network.  A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
